# Earthquake Database For Turkey
 THIS IS JUST A HOBBY NOT AN OFFICAL THING !
This project was created for hobby purposes and is not intended for scientific or commercial use. The goal of this project is to make the most popular earthquake site in Turkey more user-friendly. The data used in this project belongs to the website http://www.koeri.boun.edu.tr/scripts/lst4.asp.

In this program, you first create an account by entering your name and city. Then, you can sort earthquakes in your city and across Turkey as you wish (e.g., click on the time column to sort by time).
